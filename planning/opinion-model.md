# Public opinion time series model

## Should have
- state and national public opinions
- correlations between states based on similarities, ideally learned
- "smoothing," learned and maybe informed by past election data
- smoothing should allow for a few major events that change polls a lot
- pollster bias plus all polls bias (informed by past elections)
- should incorporate prior information on state public opinion? (or this becomes a separate model)
