Facebook's Ad Library is a searchable database. It includes ads about social issues, elections or politics that have run on Facebook Products. This report is a summary of the Library and includes data for ads that have been viewed by people in the selected country for the date range specified. Making this report available to the public is part of Facebook's efforts to increase transparency in advertising.
This file contains the following fields:

Total Amount Spent
This metric counts the amount spent by advertisers on ads in the Ad Library in the selected country for the date range specified. This metric may include amounts already invoiced as well as billable amounts that haven't been invoiced yet. For ads that are currently running, these numbers may be an estimate, since it can take up to 48 hours for ad results to be processed.

The amount shown for the report is equal to the amount spent on impressions for ads in the Library that reached people on Facebook Products in the selected country from ad accounts that had the relevant ad account currency. For full transparency we report all relevant versions of an ad stored in Facebook's system, which means numbers in this report may differ slightly from numbers in Facebook's Ads Manager.

Total Number of Ads in the Ad Library
The total number of ads in the Library that were delivered on Facebook Products in the selected country for the date range specified. For full transparency we report on all relevant versions of an ad stored in Facebook's system, which means numbers in this report may differ slightly from numbers in Facebook's Ads Manager.

Note: This report shows the number of ads about social issues, elections or politics, and the total amount spent for those ads, reaching people in the selected country for the date range specified. For full transparency we report on all relevant versions of an ad stored in the Facebook's systems, which means numbers in this report may differ slightly from numbers in Facebook's Ads Manager tool.
